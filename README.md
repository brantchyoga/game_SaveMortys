# Save The Mortys
This is a two player game with 2 parts to the game. First players will have to fill in there names and then the quiz portion of the game will progress. There is a fifty percent chance either name will be picked to be to be player 1 and go first. This is an advantage since there is currently only 9 questions in the quiz. Each player will decide a category and then decide the monetary value they wish to bet by picking either the 100, 200 or 300 question. At the end of the quiz the player with the most money can proceed to the canvas game. In case of a tie, the quiz will have to be reset and players will have to enter in there names to start over. The player who wins the quiz will play the canvas game using the arrow keys to move up, down, side to side. There is a cheat to the game which I will not disclose. If the player collects all the falling mortys he will then have won. If his ship is hit by an alien ship or a single morty reaches the bottom of the canvas then he/she will lose and have to play all over again to get to the canvas game to try again.
